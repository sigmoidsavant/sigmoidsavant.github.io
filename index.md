### CPSC 120

- Lab 6

  During lab 6 part 2, I struggled with trying to figure out how I could get IsNumberCard() in blackjack_functions.cc to recognize a card that wasn't a number. While it wasn't the most elegant solution---in fact, it was a fairly generic and bad solution---I like that this part of the lab helped me understand basic error detection using the try and catch blocks. It also helped me understand how easily potential errors can come up in code.

- Lab 11

  During lab 11 part 1, the ReadStates() function in states_functions.cc required just one loop to initialize class member variables and each state class into the vector for the State classes. I didn't realize this at the time, so it took me a while to understand that I only needed _one_ loop, and not a nested loop. The effect of the nested loop meant that it was iterating through each class too many times. Therefore I liked this class because it helped me understand the syntax for class implementation and how it differs from procedural programming. I had a bit of trouble understanding and applying the syntax for this lab, and implementing it correctly felt obvious in hindsight.

- Lab 7

  In part 1 of this lab (the only part), I saw how easily logic errors could come up in procedural programming. The conditional statements in the if blocks that managed parking on each street was harder than I thought, and it took a while to figure out the conditional statement for one of the functions. All of the logical _&&'s_ and _||'s_ were difficult to combine in a way that was both manageable, easily understandable, and implemented the correct behavior. I liked this lab because it was sort of enjoyable to try to fix these logic errors, in a torturous kind of way I suppose.
